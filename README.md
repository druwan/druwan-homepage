## Second attempt on a portfolio

My second attempt on creating a portfolio / personal website.

It is built with React and NextJS, styled with Chakra-UI and hosted at vercel.

Main difference from the 1st version is better utilization of the space, better responsive layout, dynamic icons and better theme.

Will most likely rebuild this at some point later as I'm currently not satisfied with it.
